In this project we performed:
1. Understood the Problem Statement
2. Performed basic EDA to familiarize with the data
3. Took care of missing values and datatype issues in the data
4. Understood the unique key in different data and merging the data
5. Performed Univariate analysis for both numeric and categorical variables
6. Performed Bi-variate analysis to identify redundant variables
7. Plotted Trend of each predictor with the target variable
8. Carried out in-depth analysis on the impact of Date/Week on Sales
9. Created new features that might add value to the model
10. Defined a function for each set of code that might need to be repeated again
11. Prepared the data for modelling
12. Made prediction using statistical techniques
13. Made model using machine learning techniques
14. Created time series ARIMA models and learn to give their parameters
15. Performed Hyper-parameter tuning to get the best parameters
16. Learned how to make predictions where data is sparse
17. Compared the performance of different models using multiple metrics
